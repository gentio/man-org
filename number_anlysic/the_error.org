* the error of the result
** model error
the error comes from the difference when we make model.

The math model come from the practial, having some difference.
** the measuring error
we get the parameter by measuring

** the truncatation error
The numerial method we use in the model is an approximate method, so it have some error with the practial model.

** round error

* absolute error and relative error
** absolute error
give a real number, its approximate is x^*, x-x^* is the value between the approximate value and real value. we give it a name

\begin{equation}
\varepsilon  = x^* - x
\end{equation}
we can't now the precise value. So estimate a value. If exist a postive number \eta
\begin{equation}
|\varepsilon(x)| \leq \eta
\end{equation}
we say *\eta*  is the absolute limit of x^*
