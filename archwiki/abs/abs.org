* the speed
the abs configure file is located /etc/abs.conf

At the first, the abs server is default "rsync.archlinux.org", but it takes a long time to download a little source package.

Change the Server to "mirrirs.ustc.edu.cn" or others you like. the speed up.

* the gpg sign.
The package is sign with pgp. Only you trust the sign, you can compile the source with the makepkg.
#+begin_src
$ gpg --recv-keys <KEYID>
$ gog --lsign <KEYID>
#+end_src
The Keyid can be found in the PKGBUILD.

I have a question. If the kernel config can be change by myself, but the makepkg will check the sign of the config.x86-64. How can I change it?

So finally I do a tradnational compilation.
